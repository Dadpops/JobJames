- `users` table added; per-user scheduler digest jobs with unique APScheduler job IDs
- "Switch account" button in Settings
- Frontend: `package-lock.json` committed; Dockerfile switched from `npm ci` to `npm install`

## Phase 6 — AI & Intelligence 🔲

**Branch:** `phase-6-ai`
**Issue:** #17
**Status:** Planned

### Sub-features

#### 6a — Resume keyword matching
- Upload a resume (PDF/text) via the Settings page
- Score jobs against resume keywords in addition to search criteria
- Surface a "match %" per job card

#### 6b — Smart re-ranking
- Use Claude API to re-rank results based on full job description vs. user profile
- Run asynchronously post-search; update scores without blocking the UI

#### 6c — AI cover letter drafts
- "Draft cover letter" button per job card
- Claude-generated draft tailored to job description + user resume
- Displayed in a modal with copy-to-clipboard

#### 6d — Job fit explanation

- Generated from job description + search intent

**Depends on:** Phase 5 multi-user isolation (complete)
